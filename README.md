## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt about the details and summary tags which made this challenge a lot more easier as I did not need to use unneccesary markup.
I also learnt about the new css function, calc-size(), which allows us to perform calculations on intrinsic size values such as auto which can used to animate height using only css. However, this feature is not widely supported by browser.

### Continued development

My solution lack any animations because of my limited knowledge of javascript libraries. My aim for now is to overcome this limitation.
